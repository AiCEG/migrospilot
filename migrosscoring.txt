# Plan for scoring each migros branch by close municipalities (income and population data)

## Data Sources
1. Migros branches data (migrosfilialen.json)
   - Location (coordinates)
   - Branch type limited to only "M, MM, MMM, VOI"
   - Branch size/capacity

2. Population data (GWS2023_GMDE.csv)
   - Total population per municipality
   - Population density
   - Age distribution (if available)

3. Income data (Durchschnittliches steuerbares Einkommen.csv)
   - Average taxable income per capita
   - Total taxable income per municipality

## Processing Steps
1. Data Preparation
   - Clean and standardize municipality names across datasets
   - Handle missing or incomplete data
   - Normalize income and population metrics

2. Geospatial Processing
   - Geocode each Migros branch location
   - Use OpenRouteService to create 20-minute bicycle radius polygons
   - Identify municipalities that fall within each radius
   - Calculate the percentage of each municipality's area within the radius

3. Scoring Model Components
   a) Population Score
      - Weighted by distance from branch (closer = higher weight)
      - Consider population density within radius
      - Account for potential customer base (e.g., exclude very young/old populations)

   b) Income Score
      - Weighted by distance from branch
      - Consider average disposable income
      - Account for purchasing power differences

   c) Competition Score
      - Identify competing stores within radius by using openstreetmap
      - Weight by store type and size if possible
      - Consider market saturation

   d) Branch Type Score
      - Different scoring weights for M/MM/MMM/VOI branches
      - research basic informations about capacity and service level of M/MM/MMM/VOI
      - Consider branch capacity and service level

4. Final Scoring Formula
   Score = (Population_Score * W1) + (Income_Score * W2) - (Competition_Score * W3) + (Branch_Type_Score * W4)
   Where W1, W2, W3, W4 are weights to be determined based on business priorities

## Output
1. For each branch:
   - Total score
   - Component scores (population, income, competition, branch type)
   - List of municipalities within radius
   - basic information about the area and branch
   - Visual representation of service area

2. Aggregated analysis:
   - Score distribution across all branches
   - Identification of high-potential areas
   - Recommendations for branch optimization

## Validation
1. Compare scores with actual branch performance data (if available)
2. Sensitivity analysis of scoring weights
3. Cross-validation with different radius sizes
4. Expert review of scoring results

## Next Steps
1. Implement data processing pipeline
2. Develop scoring algorithm
3. Create visualization tools
4. Build validation framework
5. Document methodology and assumptions
