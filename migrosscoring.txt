# Plan for scoring each migros branch by close municipalities (income and population data)

## Data Sources
1. ✅ Migros branches data (migrosfilialen.json)
   - Location (coordinates)
   - Branch type limited to only "M, MM, MMM, VOI"
   - Branch size/capacity

2. ✅ Population data (GWS2023_GMDE.csv)
   - Total population per municipality
   - Population density
   - Age distribution (if available)

3. ✅ Income data (Durchschnittliches steuerbares Einkommen.csv)
   - Average taxable income per capita
   - Total taxable income per municipality

## Processing Steps
1. ✅ Data Preparation
   - Clean and standardize municipality names across datasets
   - Handle missing or incomplete data
   - Normalize income and population metrics

2. ✅ Geospatial Processing
   - Geocode each Migros branch location
   - Use OpenRouteService to create 20-minute bicycle radius polygons
   - Identify municipalities that fall within each radius
   - Calculate the percentage of each municipality's area within the radius

3. Scoring Model Components
   a) Population Score (partly done. part with openrouteservice is missing)
      - Weighted by distance from branch (closer = higher weight)
      - Consider population density within radius
      - Account for potential customer base (e.g., exclude very young/old populations)
      - ! use openrouteservice to calculate an additional area of 10min bycicle ride for inner circle and outer circle of scoring. then gradual, linear decay in scoring.

   b) ⏳ Income Score
      - Weighted by distance from branch
      - Consider average disposable income
      - Account for purchasing power differences

   c) ⏳ Competition Score
      - Identify competing stores within radius by using openstreetmap
      - Weight by store type and size if possible
      - Consider market saturation

   d) ⏳ Branch Type Score
      - Different scoring weights for M/MM/MMM/VOI branches
      - research basic informations about capacity and service level of M/MM/MMM/VOI
      - Consider branch capacity and service level

4. ⏳ Final Scoring Formula
   Score = (Population_Score * W1) + (Income_Score * W2) - (Competition_Score * W3) + (Branch_Type_Score * W4)
   Where W1, W2, W3, W4 are weights to be determined based on business priorities

## Current Progress
1. ✅ Basic scoring system implemented with:
   - Population coverage (normalized to 50k population)
   - Area coverage (normalized to 75km²)
   - Reach factor
   - Current weights: Population (50%), Area (30%), Reach Factor (20%)

2. ✅ Initial results show:
   - Score range: 0.62 to 1.00
   - Average score: 0.94
   - Top performing locations in Basel area
   - Good distribution of scores across different locations

## Next Steps
1. ⏳ Enhance scoring model with income data
2. ⏳ Implement competition analysis using OpenStreetMap
3. ⏳ Add branch type scoring
4. ⏳ Implement final weighted scoring formula
5. ⏳ Create visualization tools
6. ⏳ Build validation framework
7. ⏳ Document methodology and assumptions

## Validation
1. ⏳ Compare scores with actual branch performance data (if available)
2. ⏳ Sensitivity analysis of scoring weights
3. ⏳ Cross-validation with different radius sizes
4. ⏳ Expert review of scoring results
